    <h1 class="tracking-in-expand">Big question: ‚ÄúWhat makes a team the most successful?‚Äù üßê</h1>
    <center><img src="success.jpg" alt="World Cup"></center>
      <h3>Project information ‚ÑπÔ∏è</h3>
      <p> The dataset used has specific statistics based on 9,074 games from the biggest 5 European Soccer leagues: England, Spain, Germany, Italy, France from 2011/2012 season to 2016/2017 season as of 1/25/17, coming out to be a total of 941,009 events (represented by id_event). We decided to display the visualizations by first showing the success rate of one team when playing other teams in a heat map. Selecting a team row (on the y axis) highlights their record against all other teams: red indicates a win, blue a loss, and the brightness of the color the degree. The color scale at right shows this color pattern with a key. Hovering over a box brings up game by game results for that combination of teams in a small bar chart, where positive bars are a win and negative bars are a loss, and the height of the bars is the number of goals won/lost by. The visualization defaults to aggregates across all years, but a particular season may be selected in the year drop-down menu. Then below that we compare two teams that can be selected from dropdown menu‚Äôs so that the user can find the information that they care about. We see the comparison of successful and failed assist types when the two selected teams play each other. Then we see the locations of where goals were shot and successfully scored for each team. Soccer is arguably the most popular sport in the world with an estimated four billion fans. We believed these encoding decisions were best because fans care about their own team and their statistics but also would want to be able to compare and analyze data when going into a game. </p>
      <h3>Design and Development üé® üñå</h3>
      <p> Even though we were only working with a dataset with 5 European Soccer Leagues over a six year period there was a great deal of data to work with. The original data file was too large for the site to load and took so long to the point where we had to create smaller csv‚Äôs for each of the specific visualizations. We learned a lot about the importance of organizing and understanding a dataset fully before attempting to create visualizations. We attempted to distribute the work as evenly as possible between the four team members. Being online and not really being able to meet in person to work on this project definitely made it a little difficult but we learned a lot from the experience and have developed skills that we can use moving forward on team projects that are not necessarily with people you see in person. </p>
